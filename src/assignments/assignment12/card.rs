//! Flipping card game.
//!
//! HINT: For this assignment, you have to see `play` function in `card_grade.rs` file.
//! Multiple threads will be created and they will run as enemy bots(`bot_threads`).
//! Strategy of the enemy bots is implemented in the closure of the `thread::spawn` function.
//! Your goal is to beat them so that there are more white cards than blue cards in the ground.
//! Write your strategy in the `flip_card_strategy` function of the `Player` struct.
//!
//! Have fun!
