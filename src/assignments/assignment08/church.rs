//! Church Numerals
//!
//! This exercise involves the use of "Church numerals", a
//! representation of natural numbers using lambda calculus, named after
//! Alonzo Church. Each Church numeral corresponds to a natural number `n`
//! and is represented as a higher-order function that applies a given function `f` `n` times.
//!
